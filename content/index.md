Hi, I'm Tim. This is my website for posting notes and occasional projects.  Among other things I'm interested in aerospace engineering, machine learning / artificial intelligence, complex systems, and active inference. I live in Colorado and enjoy hiking, trail running (including the occasional ultramarathon), biking, and climbing.

You can find me on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/tims457)

[Papers to read](https://tims457.notion.site/bdb354e530134df4a386a5624badc029?v=20a85de48c2d4bb59a5316acf240c49e&pvs=4): A Notion site where I post interesting papers and blog posts I'm reading.

[arXiv Front Page](https://sullivantm.com/arxiv-frontpage): scrapes arXiv daily and uses a language model to list new papers about topics Iâ€™m interested in (paused temporarily).
